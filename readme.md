## Setup

This desktop app assists in creating consistent Toggl.com time entries.

Authentication for the Toggl.com web api is performed with a user token which we save locally in an environment variable named TOGGL_COM_API_KEY.

Each user in Toggl.com has an API token. They can find it under "My Profile" in their Toggl account.
