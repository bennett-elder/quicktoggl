## Configuring the App

Create an Environment variable named TOGGL_COM_API_KEY with your toggl.com API Key. 

Each user in Toggl.com has an API token. They can find it under "My Profile" in their Toggl account.

If you have an issue retrieving the API token from the environment variable when debugging locally,
it is recommended that you close Visual Studio and reopen it:
